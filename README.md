#Sales Data Analysis and Visualization
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data from various stores that sell different categories of products. The main objective is to clean the dataset and create insightful visualizations to understand the sales patterns and trends.

#Project Overview
The dataset contains information about sales transactions from different stores, including product categories, sales amounts, and other relevant details. The project involves:

Data Cleaning: The raw dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering out irrelevant information to prepare the data for analysis.

Data Visualization: After cleaning the data, various types of visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations include:

Bar Charts: To compare the sales of different product categories across various stores.
Pie Charts: To display the proportion of sales for different product categories.
Additional visualizations to highlight key sales trends and patterns.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: For making statistical graphics and more advanced visualizations.
#How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to see the data cleaning process and visualizations.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data, offering valuable insights into sales performance across different stores and product categories. The visualizations created help in understanding sales trends and making data-driven decisions.
